<START_OF_DESCRIPTION>
{distractor_object_description}

Task:
1. Similarity analysis.
Analyze how closely the detected scene description aligns with the known facts about the target {target_object}. Provide a similarity score between 0 and 10, where:
- 0 = The detected {target_object} is not the target object.
- 10 = The detected {target_object} is definitely the target object.
- If no information about the target is available, the score should be -1.

2. Question Generation:
- The question is for the target object, not the detected one.
- Ask exactly one specific, relevant, and human-answerable question related to the target object that maximizes information gain for identifying the target {target_object}.
- Do not ask speculative or irrelevant questions 
- The question should be grounded in observable or known details from the scene, focusing on key characteristics that can help confirm or refute the identity of the target object.
